What is an ideal trading frequency to trade stocks as a retail investor? In this project I explore a few basic trading/investing strategies to identify the most effective trading frequency. This app allows user to evaluate buy-and-hold with dollar cost averaging strategy against daily hold overnight and don't hold overnight strategies. You can find an app located here: https://trading-frequency.herokuapp.com/

Through this app you select start and end dates, initial investment, regular investment and it's frequency for buy & hold portfolio and the app returns % profile return for the strategy. After you can compare performance of buy-and-hold method to the daily daily hold overnight and don't hold overnight strategies.
